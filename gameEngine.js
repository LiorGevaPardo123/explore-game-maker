 * Spellen Maken Helper Library  Version 0.00
 *
 *
 * TODO clean this up, and maybe move it to the doc page
 * Talk about how this is written:
 * Readability for folks who are new coders or unfamiliar with JavaScript the highest priority
 * NOT written for performance, or to be elegant or as an example of good coding practice
 * This is written so that what the code is doing is as transparent as possible, so it's
 *  easy to edit or replace with one's own code.
 *
 * Input uses KeyboardEvent.key values, meaning that key position will depend on players
 *  keyboard layout, and that holding SHIFT will result in different values.  I went this
 *  way because I believe it's the simplest to grasp (even though it's not robust). If
 *  you don't like this behavior, you'll probably want to use KeyboardEvent.code instead
 *
 * Document how keyCatcher and keyState work.  keyCatcher is NOT unset when a keyup event
 *  happens, so that if a player just TAPS a key really quick and the keyup happens before
 *  the next mainLoop, isKeyHeld still returns true for that key.  Instead, keyState is
 *  used to track both keyups and downs, and at the end of each mainLoop call the keyCatcher
 *  is purged and then updated with the values of keyState.
 *
 * Note that initMainLoop can take user data, in case they want to avoid using global
 *  variables.  Give example
